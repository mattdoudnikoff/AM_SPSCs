    "Best practices for loading data includes using and modifything the following function. As long as the naming convention is consistent and you set it up right, this is faster than changing the varying things by hand. It also depends on what exactly you want to load so you have to think about strucutures but typically when it is the example of average backorders, a single data file will have a single column of length networks you started.
